TODO
===============
* Show manual page on pressing enter in the search
  field

* Optimize performance, in particular, implement
  lazy resource loading!


KNOWN BUGS
===============
* the small icon will not be used when dragging
  the FireMan button into a small toolbar (CSS
  looks fine?).

  Saw it working on a debian firefox.

* Rendering error in manpage log1p(3). A misparsed
  headline is rendered really ugly.
