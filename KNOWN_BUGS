* the small icon will not be used when dragging
  the FireMan button into a small toolbar (CSS
  looks fine?).

  Saw it working on a debian firefox.

* Automagically adding the FireMan button in front
  of the search bar does not work because of a mysteric
  bug not showing the navigation bar after getting
  it with document.getElementById (see Overlay XUL).

  This is propably a good behaviour to not automatically
  add the icon.

* Bullets are not parsed for rendering.
