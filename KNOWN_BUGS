* the small icon will not be used when dragging
  the FireMan button into a small toolbar (CSS
  looks fine?)

* Automagically adding the FireMan button in front
  of the search bar does not work because of a mysteric
  bug not showing the navigation bar after getting
  it with document.getElementById (see Overlay XUL)
