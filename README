FireMan
The local firefox manual page viewer.


0. Requirements

Firefox 3.0 and higher required.

A "zip" program is required.

Be sure to have a 'sed' (man 1 sed) installed with infile (-i) support
(ex. GNU sed).

On OpenBSD install the "gsed" package.


1. Building

Type "make" to build a XPI extension package if you meet the
requirements.


2. Using

Start Firefox and choose "File" -> "Open File..." and choose the XPI
file from this directory.


3. Developing

To have a faster development, create a file, named like the application
id with the path to the build directory in it. Example:

  pwd > \
  ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profileid>/extensions/fireman\@new-thoughts.org

Afterwards, Firefox will load the current state on start.
